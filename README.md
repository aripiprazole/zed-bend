# Zed support for bend

This extension add suport for [Zed](https://zed.dev) for the [Bend](https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/bend/blob/main/GUIDE.md) programming language.

## Features

- [x] Syntax highlighting for Bend using [LaBatata101's TreeSitter grammar](https://github.com/LaBatata101/tree-sitter-bend)
- [ ] Language Server Integration (there's no LS yet AFAIK)
- [ ] Syntax highlighting for HV, maybe??? (Not sure if it's useful, and if it makes sense as part of the same extension).
